# Randy Tom's Burritos

## Introduction
  - This project was a group assignment for Turing School of Software and Design's Front End Module 3.  We created a movie-ratings website called Randy Tom's Burritos. 
  - This was our first project in React. It utilizes both class and functional components, Router, and Cypress testing. 
  - When the browser loads, the user is taken to a home page where they can view a list of movie posters. If the user clicks on a movie poster, they will be taken to a page that lists details only about that specific movie.
  - When a user is at the movie details page they will see a button that will navigate to a page where that movie's trailer can be viewed and another button that can take them back to the homepage to view all the movie posters again.
  
## Setup
Copy, paste, and run this code-block in your terminal to checkout our site.  
 ```
git clone git@github.com:NickLiggett/RandyTomBurritos.git
cd RandyTomBurritos
npm start
```

## Application in Action

## Technologies
  - React
  - XML
  - CSS
  - VSCode
  - Router
  - Cypress

## Goals, Challenges, and Wins
### Goals
- Learn React to create an app based on user stories
- Fully test all user stories using Cypress
- Incorporate API calls to fetch each movie's data
- Include an embedded youtube video on the movie trailer's page
- Incorporate Router for easy browser and url navigation
- Get more comfortable with UI design and incorporate microinteractions 

### Challenges
- Refactoring our original conditional rendering to incorporate Router
- Organization of multiple fetch calls within different components
- Setting up our component architecture

### Wins
- Partner dynamics and collaboration; we both learned a lot during this process and each got to experiment with different parts of the project
- Learning the ease of React after vanilla JavaScript! 

## Possible Future Extensions
  - Create a login functionality
  - Incorporate a comments section
  - Show rating on homepage
  - Filter or search by genre
