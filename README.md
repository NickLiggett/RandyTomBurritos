## Introduction
  - This project was a group assignment for Turing School of Software and Design's Front End Module 3.  We created a movie-ratings website called Randy Tom's Burritos. 
  - When the browser loads, the user is taken to a home page where they can view a list of movie posters. If the user clicks on a movie poster, they will be taken to a page that lists details only about that specific movie.
  - When a user is at the movie details page they will see a button that will navigate to a page where that movie's trailer can be viewed and another button that can take them back to the homepage to view all the movie posters again.
  
## Setup
Copy, paste, and run this code-block in your terminal to checkout our site.  
 ```
git clone git@github.com:NickLiggett/RandyTomBurritos.git
cd RandyTomBurritos
npm start
```
